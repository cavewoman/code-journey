## Welcome to Code Journey

I am a full stack developer who started my journey much like you. I majored in Mathematics at Berry College and had little formal training in Computer Science. But the small taste of coding I did have drove me to pursue a career in development.

Upon graduating I gathered several online resources and created a daily plan to acheive my goal. I made it my job for 2 months to learn programming. I got up at 8am and worked until 5pm (with a lunch break of course) on the plan I had laid out before myself. And sure enough, I was able to get through all of the tutorials I had set out to do.

To be clear, I was not a full stack developer by any means after completing my training, but I had gained valuable learning tools as well as a better understanding of how things worked. I then set out to find a job and was successful in finding one!

My hope with this site is to be able to help you do the same! I completely am aware that not everyone has 8 hours a day to put into your journey. I was fortunate enough to be living with some family friends who put me up for free and I maintained a part time job in the evening for the rest of my expenses. So I will be providing several options so you can learn at a pace that suits your life!

## Trail Tips

### This journey is not for the faint of heart.
Programming is incredibly fun! However, at times it can be extremely difficult. You will find yourself failing and failing often. This is ok! This is great, actually! Failing helps us learn and iterate, which are both crucial to the software development process. When you feel like you've hit a wall and nothing is working, take a small break. Do something totally unrelated. Then come back to the problem and keep pushing. I promise it will be worth it and you will be better for it!

### Community
As you are learning (secret: you will be doing this your entire development journey) I encourage you to get involved with your local development community. [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/) is a great place to get started. I have found many tech communities post their events here. Find a hack night or a cool workshop or even social and GO! You will not regret this. Here you will meet people who can help encourage you along in your journey as well as help you through tough problems.

#### Opinions
As you a join the development community you will find everyone has an opinion on what you should or shouldn't be learning and whether Vim or Emacs is best (hint Vim is). This can be incredibly overwhelming. My advice here would be to listen. Ask questions. Try and understand why they hold the opinion without taking on the opinion yourself at first. Opinons, while good and definitely necessary, can end up shutting you off from learning things that may be right for you. Beware of those who work in absolutes. Technology is constantly changing and as a developer you will need to change to stay up to date. If you ground yourself in "this is best and it should only be done this way" you can back yourself into a corner with a tough journey to get out of it.

TLDR: Stay open minded.

### Routine
I know this may sounds like common sense but I found making the learning part of my development journey a routine really helped me to achieve my goal. Figure out when the best time for you to put in time to learn is. This may be early in the morning before you fully start your day or before bed. Give yourself time to figure this out. If you set out for one routine and find it not really working don't fret. You are not a failure. Just re-evaluate and try a different time.

I recommend that when you do find the right time-  protect it. Pretend like it is your job and you must do it without distraction. This will be tough to do at first but it will get easier.
