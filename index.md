## Welcome to Code Journey

I am a full stack developer who started my journey much like you. I majored in Mathematics at Berry College and had little formal training in Computer Science. But the small taste of coding I did have drove me to pursue the career in development.

Upon graduating I gathered several online resources and created a daily plan to acheive my goal. I made it my job for 2 months to learn programming. I got up at 8am and worked until 5pm (with a lunch break of course) on the plan I had laid out before me. And sure enough I was able to get through all of the tutorials I had set out to.

To be clear I was not a full stack developer by any means after completing my training, but I had gained valuable learning tools as well as a better understanding of how things worked. I set out to find a job and was successful in finding one!

My hope with this site is to be able to help you do the same! I completely am aware that not everyone has 8 hours a day to put into your journey. I was fortunate enough to be living with some family friends who put me up for free and I maintained a part time job in the evening for the rest of my expenses. So I will be providing several options so you can learn at a pace that suits your life!
